## SUMMARY

After a long period of teaching what I love, how to use MATLAB and FPGAs to do __magic things_, I started a new adventure in my professional life two years ago as a test engineer in the automotive industry. There have been some difficulties, but more importantly, I have learned the values of a world-class organization and how to be problem-solving oriented.
